Analyze the following search results claiming to be comparisons involving "{product_name}".

{context}

Identify which items are ACTUAL COMPARISON ARTICLES (detailed comparisons with other products, vs articles, alternatives analysis) vs NON-COMPARISONS (single product reviews, product descriptions, general guides).

Filter out:
- Single product reviews (not comparing with others)
- Product descriptions or specifications
- Generic buying guides without specific comparisons
- News articles
- Articles that don't actually compare products

Return ONLY the numbers (comma-separated) of items that are ACTUAL COMPARISONS. If none are actual comparisons, return "NONE".

Example response: 2,4,6
