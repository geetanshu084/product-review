Analyze the following search results claiming to be reviews of "{product_name}".

{context}

Identify which items are ACTUAL PRODUCT REVIEWS (genuine user experiences, expert reviews, hands-on tests) vs NON-REVIEWS (product descriptions, specifications, how-to guides, news articles, general articles).

Filter out:
- Product descriptions or specifications
- Generic "how to use" guides
- News articles about the product launch
- List articles that don't contain actual reviews
- Articles that just describe features without testing
- Also filter out items from brand of the product

Return ONLY the numbers (comma-separated) of items that are ACTUAL REVIEWS. If none are actual reviews, return "NONE".

Example response: 1,3,5,7
